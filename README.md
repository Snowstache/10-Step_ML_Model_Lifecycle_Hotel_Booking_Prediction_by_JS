# ° Overview:

This repository contains a comprehensive Machine Learning Project, showcasing the end-to-end lifecycle of building a Predictive Model for a Hotel Booking Prediction. 
Leveraging Python within Jupyter Notebook, this project incorporates multiple visualization techniques, as well as 5 different machine learning algorithms, to predict hotel bookings accurately.


# ° Key Features:

- Utilizes Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN, and Decision Tree algorithms.
- Covers the complete ML model development lifecycle in ten systematic steps (there's a bonus too!).
- Explores data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, visualizations, analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
- Provides insights into each algorithm's performance and comparison metrics.
  

# ° Technologies Used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library (for tasks related to data: import, export, manipulation, etc.)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn library (for multi-dimensional plotting)
- Scikit-learn library (for machine learning algorithms, train/test data splitting, confusion matrix creation, accuracy scores, etc.)
- Plotly.express (for interactively-visual geographic analysis)
